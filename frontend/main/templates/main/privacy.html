        <p>This privacy policy covers only this website, not any NamelessMC
         websites hosted here.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>This website uses cookies for sessions (for logging in) and for
         storing a CSRF token (for security). We do not use any tracking
         cookies.</p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>We only store data you explicity provide us. For example, during
         sign-up you provide a username and email address. We do not store
         IP addresses right now but we may in the future if it is necessary
         to combat spam. We also (obviously) store all website data. The
         server is located in the Netherlands, protected by European data
         protection regulations. Our backups are encrypted client side. We
         will never share your data with third parties, we make money by
         selling hosting, not personal data.</p>

        <p>Currently, there's no way to delete your account through the web
         interface. We do plan to add this functionality in the near future.
         When you delete files through SFTP or delete your entire website,
         your data may stick around for up to a year in our backups. You can
         request it to be deleted completely by contacting us.</p>
